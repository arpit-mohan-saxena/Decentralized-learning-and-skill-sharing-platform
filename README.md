# Decentralized learning and skill sharing platform
 A Decentralized Learning and Skill-Sharing Platform is a blockchain-powered ecosystem designed to revolutionize education by enabling peer-to-peer learning, secure credential verification, and cryptocurrency-based transactions. Unlike traditional platforms, this system eliminates intermediaries, allowing learners and educators to connect directly while ensuring transparency and trust through smart contracts. Payments can be made using cryptocurrencies, making education globally accessible without banking restrictions. Additionally, a tokenized incentive system rewards users for active participation, fostering a self-sustaining learning community. With decentralized storage and blockchain-based certifications, the platform ensures data security, privacy, and verifiability of skills. This project is a work in progress, and development updates will be shared on GitHub.
